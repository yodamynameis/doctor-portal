This web project is designed to facilitate e-channeling for medical establishments such as clinics and hospitals. It enables clients or patients to request appointments with doctors online while assisting doctors in managing their appointment schedules efficiently. The system streamlines the scheduling process by organizing patient appointment requests, which are submitted to the selected doctor.

The platform comprises three primary roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. Administrators manage the system by populating the list of doctors, specifying their specialties, details, and credentials. Patients can explore the system's website to find doctors based on their required specialties. They can view doctors' weekly schedules to select suitable dates and times for appointments and submit their requests. Doctors, in turn, can review all scheduled appointments and pending patient requests, ensuring optimal availability and time management.
